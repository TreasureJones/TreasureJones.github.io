                        Shrek is about a grumpy ogre who wants his swamp back. 
                        To do so, he agrees to rescue Princess Fiona for Lord 
                        Farquaad. Along the way, Shrek falls for Fiona, who 
                        hides a secret—she turns into an ogre at night. In the 
                        end, Fiona chooses Shrek, and they live happily ever 
                        after.

                        Shrek was created by DreamWorks Animation and released 
                        in 2001. It was based on a 1990 children’s book by 
                        William Steig. The film used groundbreaking computer 
                        animation and was originally voiced by Chris Farley, 
                        but after his death, Mike Myers took over, giving Shrek 
                        his iconic Scottish accent.
