                    First conceived by Brennan as a feature film, Glee was 
                    primary written by him, Murphy, and Falchuk in the first 
                    two seasons; Murphy and Falchuk also served as the series' 
                    initak directors. The pilot episode premiered on May 19, 
                    2009, and the first season aired from September 9, 2009, to
                    June 8, 2010. Subsequent seasons aired from September 
                    through May, while the sixth and final season aired from 
                    January to March 2015. Glee features on-screen musicial 
                    performances chosen by Murphy and produced by adam Anders
                    and Peer Astrom, ranging from show tunes to chart hits. 
                    Songs covered in the series were released through the iTunes
                    Store during the week of broadcast, and several Glee albums
                    have been released by Columbia Records. The series' music 
                    has been commercially successful, with over 36 million 
                    digital single sales and 11 million album sales worldwide 
                    through October 2011. Other merchandise includes DVD and 
                    Blu-ray releases, an iPad application, and karaoke games for 
                    the Wii console. The cast embarked on live concert tours 
                    after filming the first and second seasons; a concert film 
                    based on the 2011 tour, produced by Murphy and directed by 
                    Kevin Tancharoen, was given limited theatrical release in 
                    August 2011.

                    Glee received generally favorable reviews from critics in 
                    its first season, while reception to the later five varied. 
                    Among its many accolades, it won six Primetime Emmy Awards 
                    (including acting wins for Lynch and guest stars Neil Patrick
                    Harris and Gwyneth Paltrow, along with Murphy's direction 
                    of the pilot), four Golden Globe Awards (including two 
                    consecutive awards for Best Television Series – Musical or 
                    Comedy and acting wins for Lynch and Colfer), and the 2009 
                    Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an
                    Ensemble in a Comedy Series. In 2011, Fox chose the show 
                    to fill the coveted time slot following the network's 
                    coverage of Super Bowl XLV.

                    In 2013, following Cory Monteith's death and the airing of 
                    his tribute episode "The Quarterback", Murphy announced that
                    the sixth season would be the series' last.[2] After 121 
                    episodes and over 729 music performances, Glee concluded on
                    March 20, 2015.[3]

                <h4>Main article: List of Glee episodes</h4>
                <p>
                    The series centers on a show choir and glee club at the 
                    fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio.
                    Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) takes over 
                    the glee club after former teacher Sandy Ryerson (Stephen 
                    Tobolowsky) is fired for inappropriate contact with a 
                    student, and attempts to restore the newly-named "New 
                    Directions" to its former glory while tending to his 
                    developing feelings for his co-worker, guidance counselor 
                    Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays). Will must also defend the glee 
                    club's existence from scheming cheerleading coach Sue 
                    Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and at times, school Principal 
                    Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). The series gives focus to 
                    the lives of the eventual members of the New Directions: 
                    their romances, their love of singing and desire for 
                    popularity clashing with their membership in the low-status 
                    club, and the many vicissitudes that come with high school 
                    and teenhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first season follows the New Directions competing for 
                    the first time on the show choir circuit, from their win at 
                    the Sectionals competition (episode 13) to their loss at 
                    Regionals (episode 22). Social issues explored in this season
                    include sex, relationship problems, homosexuality, teenage
                    pregnancy, disabilities, acceptance. The inaugural members 
                    of the New Directions include Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), 
                    an ambitious performer driven by her dreams of becoming a 
                    Broadway theatre star; Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), the 
                    school's sometimes-slow-witted star quarterback; Artie 
                    Abrams (Kevin McHale), a boy with a physical disability; 
                    Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), an effeminate, openly gay boy; 
                    Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), an aspiring vocal diva whose 
                    talents go unrecognized; Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz),
                    a shy goth longing to be popular; Noah "Puck" Puckerman 
                    (Mark Salling), a delinquent in need of direction; and
                    Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), a popular cheerleader who 
                    experiences a teenage pregnancy.

                <h4>Main article: List of Glee characters</h4>
                <p>
                    During their auditions, actors without any theatrical 
                    experience needed to demonstrate that they could also sing 
                    and dance. Chris Colfer had no previous professional
                    experience, but Murphy wrote in the character Kurt Hummel 
                    for him. Jayma Mays auditioned with the song "Touch-a, 
                    Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" from The Rocky Horror Show, 
                    while Cory Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself
                    acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical 
                    tape, in which he sang "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style
                    version" of REO Speedwagon's "Can't Fight This Feeling".
                    Kevin McHale came from a boy-band background, having 
                    previously been part of the group Not Like Them. He 
                    explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds 
                    reflects the range of different musical styles within 
                    the show itself: "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, 
                    current stuff, R&B. Even the musical theatre stuff is 
                    switched up. You won't always recognize it." Jane 
                    Lynch was originally supposed to have a recurring role 
                    as Sue Sylvester, but was made a series regular 
                    when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC 
                    fell through. The cast is contracted for a potential
                    three Glee films, with their contract stating that 
                    "[The actor] hereby grants Fox three exclusive, 
                    irrevocable options to engage [the actor] in up to, 
                    respectively, three feature-length motion pictures."
                    Murphy said in December 2010 that he wasn't interested 
                    in doing a Glee movie "as a story", and added, "I 
                    might do it as a live concert thing." Glee: The 3D
                    Concert Movie, filmed during the 2011 Glee Live! In 
                    Concert! tour, was released on August 12, 2011.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the original characters graduated from McKinley 
                    High at the end of the third season. Murphy said, "We didn't 
                    want to have a show where they were in high school for eight
                    years. We really wanted to be true to that experience."
                    Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch 
                    would remain to provide continuity to the series, though 
                    according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt
                    in particular—would likely remain on the show after they 
                    graduate.[28] In May 2012, Murphy said that just because
                    a character on the show graduates high school does not 
                    mean that they are leaving, "A lot of people have been 
                    writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — 
                    they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking 
                    about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the
                    choir room with that exact group of people.' At least 
                    that's what she told me ... When I read that [tweet,] 
                    I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's 
                    excited about where her character is going. They all 
                    are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." 
                    He then continued: "They're all coming back. Anyone who 
                    is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes."

                <div id="Production">
                <h1>Production</h1>
                <h4>Conception</h4>
                <p>
                    Ian Brennan conceived Glee based on his own experience as a 
                    member of the Prospect High School show choir in Mount 
                    Prospect, Illinois. He initially envisioned Glee as a 
                    film, rather than a television series, and wrote the first
                    draft in August 2005 with the aid of Screenwriting for 
                    Dummies. He completed the script in 2005, but could not 
                    generate interest in the project for several years.
                    Mike Novick, a television producer and a friend of 
                    Brennan's from Los Angeles, was a member of the same gym 
                    as Ryan Murphy, and gave him a copy of Brennan's script.
                    Murphy had been in a show choir in college and felt he 
                    could relate to the script. Murphy and his Nip/Tuck 
                    colleague Brad Falchuk suggested that Glee be produced as
                    a television show. The script was entirely rewritten,
                    and was picked up by Fox within fifteen hours of being
                    received. Murphy attributed that, in part, to the 
                    network's success with American Idol. "It made sense for the
                    network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to 
                    do something in that vein," he said.[40] Murphy and Falchuk
                    became the show's executive producers and showrunners, 
                    Brennan became a co-executive producer and Novick a 
                    producer. Brennan, Falchuk and Murphy started by writing 
                    "all the episodes".

                    Glee is set at the fictional William McKinley High School in 
                    Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself 
                    grew up in Indiana, and recalled childhood visits to Ohio to 
                    the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the 
                    show is filmed at Paramount Studios and Helen Bernstein High 
                    School in Hollywood.

                    The first season of Glee consists of twenty-two episodes.
                    The pilot episode was originally broadcast on May 19, 2009.
                    The series returned on September 9, 2009, airing an 
                    additional twelve episodes on Wednesdays in the 9:00 pm 
                    timeslot until December 9, 2009, for a total of thirteen 
                    episodes. On September 21, 2009, nine more episodes were 
                    ordered for the first season by Fox, and the first of 
                    these episodes was broadcast on April 13, 2010. These 
                    episodes aired on Tuesday evenings at 9:00 pm. On January 
                    11, 2010, it was announced that Fox had commissioned a 
                    second season of the show. The second season began production 
                    in June 2010. Season two began on September 21, 2010, airing 
                    in the 8:00 pm time slot on Tuesdays, and consists of 
                    twenty-two episodes. The show was chosen by Fox to fill 
                    the coveted timeslot that followed the network's coverage of 
                    Super Bowl XLV in 2011, and the network originally 
                    planned to move the show to the 9:00 pm time slot on 
                    Wednesdays following the post–Super Bowl broadcast. 
                    However, Fox later revised its schedule,leaving Glee on 
                    Tuesdays in order to concentrate on building up its weaker 
                    Wednesday and Thursday line-ups. A third season was 
                    ordered by Fox on May 23, 2010, before the end of the first 
                    season. The early renewal of the show allowed the production 
                    team to cut costs and to plan ahead when writing scripts. 
                    The third season broadcasts remained in the show's Tuesday 
                    8:00 pm time slot,[89] and began airing on September 20, 2011. 
                    The show's fourth season changed both date and time of 
                    broadcast: it moved to Thursdays in the 9:00 pm time slot, 
                    and aired after that evening's 8:00 pm music competition 
                    "results" shows—The X Factor in the fall and American Idol 
                    in midseason. The show was renewed for both a fifth and 
                    sixth season at the same time, on April 19, 2013. Reruns were 
                    also syndicated to local US stations from 2013 to 2015.

                    Glee has been syndicated for broadcast in many countries 
                    worldwide, including Australia, where cast members visited 
                    to promote the show prior to its September 2009 debut on 
                    Network Ten. Midway through season four, Glee was moved to 
                    Network Ten's digital channel Eleven due to poor ratings. 
                    It also airs in Canada on City and, previously, Global, 
                    New Zealand, Fiji, and Trinidad and Tobago. It is 
                    broadcast in South Africa, where Fox beams the episodes 
                    directly to the M-Net broadcast center in Johannesburg 
                    rather than delivering the tapes. Asian countries that 
                    broadcast Glee include Bangladesh, the Philippines, India, 
                    Malaysia, and Singapore and Myanmar.

                    The pilot episode of Glee averaged 9.62 million viewers, and 
                    the following eleven episodes attained between 6.10 and 7.65 
                    million. The mid-season finale was watched by 8.13 million 
                    viewers, with the show returning in April 2010 to a season 
                    high of 13.66 million viewers. The following six episodes 
                    attained between 11.49 and 12.98 million viewers, falling to 
                    8.99 million for the penultimate episode "Funk". Viewing 
                    figures rose to 11.07 million viewers for the season finale, 
                    giving Glee the highest finale rating for a new show in the 
                    2009–10 television season. Only the first twenty episodes of 
                    the first season were accounted for when calculating the 
                    season average due to the final two episodes airing outside 
                    the traditional sweeps period. On February 6, 2011, after 
                    the Super Bowl, Glee received its highest ever ratings, with 
                    over 26.8 million tuning in to see the special episode, with 
                    a peak of 39.5 million.
