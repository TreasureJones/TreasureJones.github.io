       <h1>Date Cardamom Syrup</h1>
       <p>
        There's something so comforting about the natural sweetness of dates,
        especially when paired with the deep, smoky warmth of black cardamom. 
        This syrup is perfect dro drizzling over pancakes, mixing into coffee,
        or sweetening a batch of oatmeal. The best part? It's super easy to make 
        and only gets better the longer it simmers. Most of the time taken in 
        this recipe is a lot of idle time!

        <h1>Boiling The Dates</h1>
        <p>
            To get started, chop up some Medjool dates, which are rich, caramel-
            sweet, and soft, perfect for this syrup. You'll combine them with 
            water in a saucepan and bring the ixture to a boil. Once its boiling, 
            lowewr the heat and let it simmer. Let it cook for 45 minutes to an 
            hour, stirring occasionally to help the dates break down. The dates
            sofftwen and infuse the water with their sweet flavor. The longer it 
            simmers, the deeper the syrup flavor will be, so don't rush it-this
            this step is key for getting that rich, caramelized taste. You can 
            go up to 2 hours!
        </p>

        <h1>Reducing The Syrup</h1>
        <p>
            Once your dates are soft and have broken down, it's time to strain 
            mixture. Use a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to separate the liquid
            from the date solids. Press down on the dates to extract every last 
            drop of syrup. Now, return the liquid gold to the saucepan and cook 
            it over low heat, stirring occasionally. This is where the magic 
            happens-slowly reduce the syrup until it thickens into a rich, 
            glossy consistency. This can take anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes, 
            but th elonger you let it simmer, the thicker and more concentrated
            the syrup becomes. If you like it extra thick, feel free to cook it
            for an additional 15-30 minutes. Once it's reached your desired 
            syrup consistency, stir in some crushed black cardamom for that
            signature smoky warmth. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes to 
            infuse the flavor. I also like to add in vanilla extract sometimes
            at this step but it's optional!
        </p>

        <p>
            ALSO, do not throw out the mushy dates when straining out the liquid.
            You can use it to make a date caramel or even a sweet date butter 
            spread!
        </p>

        <h1>Storing The Syrup & How Long It Lasts</h1>
        <p>
            After letting the syrup cool, transfer it to a jar or bottle. It'll
            keep in the fridge for up to two weeks, though I'm sure it won't
            last that long-it's just too good! You can use it in coffee, drizzle
            it over pancakes, or add it to your favorite desserts. It's a great 
            way to add natural sweetness and depth to any dish. It would also be 
            amazing on a yogurt bowl or oatmeal!

        <b>Total Time:</b> 2 Hours 30 Minutes
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Yields:</b> 1 Cup 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chopped dates (packed)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed black cardamom, more or less to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan over mediu heat, combine the chopped dates and water.
        Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cook for 50 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally, 
        until the dates soften and break down. The longer it simmers, the deeper
         the flavor. You can even cook it down longer for 1 hour and a half to 
         2 hours for a deeper more sweet syrup.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, 
        pressing the dates to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard 
        the solids</li>
        <li>Return the strained liquid to the saucepan and cook over low heat,
            stirring occasionally, until it reduces and thickens into a syrup. 
            This can take <b>30 to 45 minutes,</b> but for a richer and thicker 
            syrup, let it simmer for up to <b>an hour or more.</b>
        <li>Stir in the crushed black cardamom and optional vanilla, adding in 
            more or less to your taste, and let it infuse for 5 minutes before 
            removing from heat.</li>
        <li>Allow the syrup to cool and store in a sealed jar in the fridge for
            up to two weeks.</li>
